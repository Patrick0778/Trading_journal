## How does this project work?

This project is a modern web application for visualizing and analyzing market returns, built with React, TypeScript, Vite, shadcn-ui, and Tailwind CSS. It provides an interactive dashboard for users to view trading performance, select accounts, and analyze trading statistics through dynamic charts and tables.

### Key Features

- **Performance Chart**: Visualizes market returns and trading performance over time using interactive charts.
- **Account Selector**: Allows users to switch between different trading accounts to view specific data.
- **Trading Dashboard**: Central hub displaying key metrics, charts, and trading statistics in a user-friendly layout.
- **Trading Stats**: Summarizes important statistics such as total returns, win/loss ratios, and other performance indicators.
- **Authentication**: Secure login and account management, integrated with Supabase for backend authentication and data storage.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with shadcn-ui and Tailwind CSS for a consistent, mobile-friendly experience.

### Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: Developed with React and TypeScript for robust, type-safe UI components. Vite is used for fast development and build tooling.
- **UI Components**: Modular components (charts, tables, selectors) are organized under `src/components` and `src/components/ui` for reusability and maintainability.
- **State Management**: React hooks and context are used for managing application state, user authentication, and data fetching.
- **Backend Integration**: Supabase is used for authentication and as a backend service for storing and retrieving user and trading data.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling, while shadcn-ui offers accessible, customizable UI primitives.

### User Flow

1. **Authentication**: Users log in or sign up to access their personalized dashboard.
2. **Account Selection**: Users select a trading account to view specific performance data.
3. **Dashboard Interaction**: Users explore charts and statistics, filter data, and analyze trading performance.
4. **Real-Time Updates**: The dashboard updates dynamically as users interact with different components or as new data becomes available.

### File Structure Highlights

- `src/components/` ‚Äì Main React components (charts, dashboard, selectors, stats)
- `src/components/ui/` ‚Äì UI primitives and reusable elements (buttons, dialogs, tables, etc.)
- `src/pages/` ‚Äì Page-level components (authentication, main dashboard, not found)
- `src/integrations/supabase/` ‚Äì Supabase client and type definitions
- `src/hooks/` ‚Äì Custom React hooks for state and effect management

This architecture ensures a scalable, maintainable, and high-performance application for market return analysis.
